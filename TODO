TODO file for Gtopo

Tom Trebisky  August, 2007

These are ideas, subject to revision as the time to implement
them arises, but will give you an idea where gtopo is heading.

-- Known and not yet fixed bugs (9/1/2007)

* When using the SI_D01 full US maps, when it zooms
from STATE to ATLAS, it looses position substantially.

* Series 2 maps have a bug (sort of cosmetic)
The maplets only match at the center of the viewed area,
apparently there is a pixel change issue at this scale
as latitude changes (the same issue is there with other
map series, but is never a real issue with the size of
screen usually used).

-- fixed bugs (9/1/2007)

* I have made it a lot harder to wander off the edges of
the map coverage and get lost in white screen regions,
both while using the mouse to move and when changing
scale.  Some of the map images include sizeable sections
of scanned white paper, and there is nothing I can (at
least not easily) do about preventing wandering into
these areas.

* When using the SI_D01 full US maps, and zooming
from ATLAS to 500K, it can find no maps.  Fixed,
now it sees all 3 map series over the entire USA.

* Certain map sets (like backcountry explorer), which
have C and G named tpq files can display nothing in 100K
and maybe 500k.  This seems fine with lower case names.
Fixed 9/1/2007, this wasa problem with mixed case filenames
such as C37120E1.tpq or some such nonsense, now OK.

* this currently does not run on an x86_64 machine, which my machine
just became, so I am working on that, and worrying about regression
testing (my home machine is a 32 bit, so I will just have to
drag my feet upgrading it).  Fixed 8-28-2007, so it now runs on
both 64 and 32 bit intel machines, and while things were being
generalized, it was made to work on a big endian machine too.

* gtopo builds nicely on a big-endian OS-X mac laptop, and
runs with some reported problems, what I need is access to
such a machine for half a day or so.

=== Things to definitely do, but not top priority

* Be able to print to a 8.5 by 11 inch equivalent postscript
file.  In particular the 7.5 minute maps should print at the
true 1:24,000 scale

* Be able to extract a region and emit it as a .jpg file to
be included in web pages or email or whatever.

* Get keyboard stuff working and use +- to flip forward and
back in the scale series, as well as other things.

* Make it do byte swapping so it will run on a big endian
machine (like a power PC mac, which it fails on as of 0.9.3).

=== Things to maybe do, or maybe not.

* Use a notebook with tabs on the right side to switch
between map series and indicate the current series in lieu
of (or in addition to) the right mouse click scale switching
currently used.

=== Things to probably not do.

Somewhere, I read the suggestion that a GtkImage widget could be
used in lieu of a drawing area for the kind of thing I am doing
(namely copying a single pixmap to the drawing area).  I don't know
what advantages there would be to this, maybe it would be faster
and lighter weight.  I don't know if there would be any issues
receiving events.  Pixmaps would be sent to such a widget via
gtk_widget_queue_draw.
