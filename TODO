TODO file for Gtopo

Tom Trebisky  August, 2007

These are ideas, subject to revision as the time to implement
them arises, but will give you an idea where gtopo is heading.

=== Things to definitely do, top priority

* Series 2 maps also have a bug (sort of cosmetic)
The maplets only match at the center of the viewed area,
apparently there is a pixel change issue at this scale
as latitude changes (the same issue is there with other
map series, but is never a real issue with the size of
screen usually used).

=== Things to definitely do, but not top priority

* Be able to print to a 8.5 by 11 inch equivalent postscript
file.  In particular the 7.5 minute maps should print at the
true 1:24,000 scale

* Be able to extract a region and emit it as a .jpg file to
be included in web pages or email or whatever.

* Get keyboard stuff working and use +- to flip forward and
back in the scale series, as well as other things.

=== Things to maybe do, or maybe not.

* Use a notebook with tabs on the right side to switch
between map series and indicate the current series in lieu
of (or in addition to) the right mouse click scale switching
currently used.

=== Things to probably not do.

Somewhere, I read the suggestion that a GtkImage widget could be
used in lieu of a drawing area for the kind of thing I am doing
(namely copying a single pixmap to the drawing area).  I don't know
what advantages there would be to this, maybe it would be faster
and lighter weight.  I don't know if there would be any issues
receiving events.  Pixmaps would be sent to such a widget via
gtk_widget_queue_draw.
