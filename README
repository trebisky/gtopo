Gtopo

Gtopo is a program for viewing topographic maps.
It is loosely designed as a replacement for the TOPO!
program that is sold by the National Geographic Survey.

It is able to read the .TPQ files that hold the scanned
USGS maps that they sell in sets, state by state.

For more information, see the gtopo home page:

In particular, for documentation see:

    http://cholla.mmto.org/gtopo/documentation

It should run on any linux system that has the GTK
libraries, as well as on Mac machine running OS-X.

Gtopo was written by Tom Trebisky in July of 2007.
